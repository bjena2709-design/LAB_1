# Student Performance Prediction using Machine Learning

## 📌 Overview
This project focuses on analyzing and predicting student academic performance based on demographic, social, and educational factors. The goal is to identify patterns that influence student scores and build predictive models that can assist educators in early intervention strategies.

The dataset used is **StudentsPerformance.csv**, which contains exam scores along with student background attributes.

## 🎯 Problem Statement
Educational institutions often struggle to identify students who may underperform academically. Early prediction of student performance can help educators provide timely academic support and improve learning outcomes.
